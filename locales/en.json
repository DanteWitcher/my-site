On the site you can view my drawings, the figures I put together, and perhaps, in the future, some projects in the field of programming, all this can be viewed in the 'works', you can also write me :). I am a Front-End developer, I mainly work with Angular 1-2, I love to draw, sculpt, play guitar, read (also books in English), animals, and of course programming and Linux. Thanks for attention."
